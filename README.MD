# SpringDemoService

This repository is to show how to setup and get a Java based web application to work with bare minimum code so it's easy to reference to and customize.

Hope this could help with those who are new to Java based web services and related features, like SQL database integration, non SQL database integration, basic CRUD RESTful APIs, etc. 

## Environment

* Java 8
* Maven
